# Comp.Neuro_Neuromatch_2025

This repository contains my personal Neuromatch Academy-2025 notebooks, tutorials, and code reflections. The purpose is to build an intuitive reference toolkit I can revisit for future modeling projects.

⚠️ **Note:** If you're seeing a rendering error like `'state' key missing from metadata.widgets'`, it's just GitHub being annoying.
You can still:
- ✅ Download and run this notebook in Jupyter or Colab
- ❌ But GitHub preview won’t show interactive widgets 😞
